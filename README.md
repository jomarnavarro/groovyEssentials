## Simple GROOVY project

This is a simple groovy project I created to get accustomed to the language's syntax, since I'll be working on Geb automation tool next.

# Setup

I created a simple setup in eclipse, by installing:

a) [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org)
b) [Latest JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
c) Groovy Development Tools 3.0.0 SNAPSHOT (From within Eclipse Marketplace)
